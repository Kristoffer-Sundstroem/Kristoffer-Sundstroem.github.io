I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Lule√• University of Technology, specializing in environmental economics. My research focuses on the design and implementation of environmental permits, as well as the institutional frameworks that shape them.

Lately, my research has centered on the effects of environmental regulations on effluent levels in the Swedish pulp and paper industry. Using advanced econometric techniques, including instrumental panel regression models and panel vector autoregressive models, I have analyzed the impact of regulatory regime changes and trial periods on the effectiveness of effluent limits. This work provides valuable insights into the role of policy in shaping environmental outcomes.

Looking ahead, I aspire to continue my academic journey as a postdoctoral researcher. I am particularly interested in opportunities that allow me to combine teaching with research in environmental economics.
