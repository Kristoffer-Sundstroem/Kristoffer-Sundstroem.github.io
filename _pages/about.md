I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Lule√• University of Technology, specializing in environmental economics. My research focuses on the design and implementation of environmental permits, as well as the institutional frameworks that shape them.

In my studies, I have explored topics such as the historical evolution of Swedish environmental regulations, particularly in the pulp mill industry, and analyzed the impacts of these regulations over time. Through the use of instrumental panel regression models and panel vector autoregressive models I managed to investigate the impact of both regulatory regime changes, and trial periods, on the effectiveness of effluent limits in the Swedish pulp and paper industry.

Looking ahead, I aspire to continue my academic journey as a postdoctoral researcher. I am particularly interested in opportunities that allow me to combine teaching with research in environmental economics.
